| ![][utilityEmp] | Utility Alt: Chrono Triggers | Tracer charges her blink for up to 3 seconds, gradually increasing the warp distance. |
| ![][special] | Special: Recall | Tracer bounds backward in time, cleansing all negative effects and dots, restoring 25% health and reloads her ammo. |
| ![][special2] | Special Alt: Parting Gift | Tracer goes back in time, leaving a Pulse Bomb at her starting location and restoring the amount of health lost in the last 3s. Upon arrival, she creates lightning strike around her, damaging nearby enemies for 1000% of the amount healed. |
