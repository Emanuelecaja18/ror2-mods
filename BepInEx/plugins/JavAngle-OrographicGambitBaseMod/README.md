# Orographic Gambit Base Mod

if you're here, you're probably just wondering what this thing even is, to summarrise, it's just a basemod that includes things that both House and Myst add, this is done so that when you install both mods, these things are not added twice.

As of the time of writing (and it's likely I wont keep this list updated, but we'll see) this mod adds: \
- Generic Stacking Stat Changing Buffs.
- Polymorphed Buff.
- Blind15s damage type.
- VolumeControllerComponent.

And I'll likely add more stuff to this in the future.
