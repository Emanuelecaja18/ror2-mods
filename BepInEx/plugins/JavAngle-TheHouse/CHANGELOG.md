## 2.1.0 Back Home
<details>

- Added new Primary: BulletArts: Quickdraw.
- Added new ReloadArt: All-In.
- Added new CardArt: Swipe.
- All Jacks in the Standard Spread deck have been replaced with Jack of Diamonds.
- Reworked Seven of Hearts, now grants barrier up to 50% based on how much health you have (more health giving more barrier).
- Extended the invincibility window of Russian Roulette, there is now a 1 second grace period to get to safety after the animation finishes.
- Russian Roulette now revives all dead players when it succeeds.
- Coins gold to damage ratio increased from 3 to 4.
- Wildroom has new (real) effects (I wont spoil them here).
- Tower's Multiplayer Effects now last for 2 minutes instead of lasting forever.
- Added config to make Seven of Spades only pick from vanilla buffs instead of from the entire buff catalogue (useful if you have lots of mods and don't want to configure the filter manually).
- Changed Hearts, Spades, Clubs and Crazycard's artworks to new unique ones (They were previously using the icons for Seven of Hearts, Seven of Spades, Seven of Clubs, and Wildcard respectively).

## 2.0.5 Small Patch
<details>

- Added SmartCollision to Houses Bullets, this should make his shots land more often (instead of hitting the floor).
- Adjusted the volume of cards and shots to try to make House less noisy in multiplayer.
- Added RiskOfOptions support.
- Added a config to remove the tinitus effect from Russian Roulette.
- (the base mod also received an update which should fix Russian Roulette setting the volume to 0)
- Added configs for scaling the HuD elements, and split the config for moving them around into 2 configs each, for X and Y (in order to make them work with RiskOfOptions).
- Added an icon for House's Passive 'The Game'.
- Adjusted the cycle offset of the Sprint to make the transition from landing more smooth.
- Fixed House's HUD from breaking KingKombatArena (Though, it should be noted that he definitely still breaks the mode, but now it's in a way that's entertaining >:D ).
- Removed some residual code that shouldn't have still been there.
- (I forgot to mention this when I initially pushed this update, but this patch also included:)
- Added configs to customise the filter for Spades and Mystery Shot, so that 'buffs' that aren't actually buffs or projectiles that are annoying/harmful to shoot can be filtered out.

## 2.0.0 Renovation
<details>

- ([Developer's Note] This is an incomplete changelog, genuinely, too much has changed to list it all, this is practically an all-new mod, more of a re-make than an update, but I'll try to list as many changes as I can despite this.)
- All new Model and Animations courtesy of Dotflare.
- The HUD and Crosshair has been completely remade.
- The card system has been rewritten (and should now work 100% correctly in multiplayer, 'desyncs' cannot happen anymore.)
- Every VFX has been remade.
- Every SFX has been redone.
- Every Skill Icon has been remade.
- Every Card Artwork has been remade.
- The information about cards has been moved to the Info screen.
- The loadout can now be used to select a deck, by default it will be 'standard spread', which is a new deck with toned down cards, designed to be easier to use, the old deck is now called 'Full House' and is not the default deck (but is 100% the definitive one).
- Wound Shot has been replaced with Piercing Shot, which pierces through enemies and deals increased damage.
- Queen Shot has been removed.
- Ace Shot has been reworked: now has a long wind-up, deals massively increased damage across a wide area, and even hits through walls.
- ([Developer's Note] everything following this is differences between the old House's Deck and the new Full House Deck.)
- Added a new 'Priority Shot' chamber in the cylinder, which is always fired before the other shots, but isn't loaded normally.
- Seven of Hearts now grants 50% Shield.
- Seven of Diamonds now grants gold based on the stage scaling rather than the run scaling.
- Seven of Spades has been completely reworked: now grants movement speed, and 2 completely random buffs.
- Seven of Clubs has been reworked: now loads an explodive shot in the Priority Chamber, and loads 3 'Mystery' shots (which fire a completely random projectile).
- Snake Eyes now additionally loads a Snake Shot into the Priority Chamber.
- Bust now deals damage taken to nearby enemies.
- Joker can no longer activate tower.
- Tower now has a different set of effects for Multiplayer (and for NPC's like Umbras and Goobo) and can no longer activate all of its effects at once.
- Jack has been replaced with Jack of Diamonds, which loads 6 standard shots, and slides House forward when used on the ground.
- King of Clubs now loads a Mystery Shot (I forgot what this replaced... I think it used to load a standard shot, but I cba to check).
- Queen of Hearts has been reworked: now buffs 2 random stats, but debuffs 2 other random stats.
- Ace of Spades now loads the Ace Shot into the Priotity Chamber.
- All In has been removed.
- Wheel of Fortune now has a change to grant an item when it fails, the change increasing with gold lost (this can be seen as it activating All-In when it fails).
- Russian Roulette now increases in reward based on number of stages cleared, starting at 1 common item at stage 1, and 3 legendary items by stage 9 (it is now completely unneffected by luck, this might change again in the future).
- Wildcard has been unhinged (though, steps have been taken to attempt to prevent greifing in multiplayer).
